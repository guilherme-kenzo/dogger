# What is this project?

A random dog photo fetcher. 

Usage:

    ```
    Example 1: dogger fetch -> returns url of a photo

    Example 2: dogger fetch --ascii -> returns a ascii converted representation 
    of the photo
    ```

This is mainly a sample project to get me started with go. However, I did want 
to build something fun that I could potentially use. 

It uses the [Dog Api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).
